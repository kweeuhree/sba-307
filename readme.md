This is a mock up of SamAsh.com musical website.<br>

<h3>HTML requirements</h3>
The website consists out of three text-populated pages with consistent grid:
<ul>
<li>Home page, or index.html</li>
<li>Customer support page, or help.html</li>
<li>Register an account page, or register.html</li>
</ul>
help.html can be navigated to by clicking on 'Help' in the left section of top navigation bar, and register.html by clicking on "Log In / Register' in the right section of top navigation bar. Each contains a form.
<br>
The website utilizes multiple HTML tags, including <code>nav</code>, <code>main</code>, <code>form</code>, <code>fieldset</code>, <code>table</code> <code>footer</code> etc.
<br>
The table is used in the footer of every page and contains 'About Us', 'Customer Support' and 'Quick Links' table headers.
<br>
Many different images are used thoughout in order to create an appealing look. Gifs are used in the footer of every page. Twitter and Facebook social media icons are gifs.
<br>

<code>
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="26" height="26" fill="currentColor" class="bi bi-search" viewBox="0 0 16 16">

<path d="M11.742 10.344a6.5 6.5 0 1 0-1.397 1.398h-.001q.044.06.098.115l3.85 3.85a1 1 0 0 0 1.415-1.414l-3.85-3.85a1 1 0 0 0-.115-.1zM12 6.5a5.5 5.5 0 1 1-11 0 5.5 5.5 0 0 1 11 0"/>
</svg> 
</code>
<br>
Multiple CSS selectors are used in order to achieve a fully customized website.

Alignment of elements is achieved through flexbox only.
